I added and corrected my API fetch function, and moved to my Dashboard file.
Removed Users file as It was no longer needed.
Corrected properties in my Car type to match my target API's indecies.
Removed my types file as that was no longer needed as well.
Overall simplfied this project and focused on the fundumentales on how these files tie together>
Added some styling just to give it that final flair.

What I still find challenging is using the hooks and sometimes the correct imports and keeping it simple, will practice these further!
